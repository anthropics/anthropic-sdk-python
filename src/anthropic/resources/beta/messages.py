        Args:
          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

              Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter
              only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

              Different models have different maximum values for this parameter. See
              [input and output sizes](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/input-and-output-sizes)
              for details.

          messages: Input messages.

              Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
              conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
              conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
              the next `Message` in the conversation.

              Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
              specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
              `assistant` messages. The first message must always use the `user` role.

              If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
              continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
              constrain part of the model's response.

              Example with a single `user` message:

              ```json
              [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
              ```

              Example with multiple conversational turns:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
                { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
              ]
              ```

              Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Please describe yourself using only JSON" },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Here is my JSON description:\n{" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` is
              shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following
              input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              During beta, the Messages API only accepts content blocks of type `"text"`, and
              at most one block per message.

              See our
              [guide to prompt design](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/introduction-to-prompt-design)
              for more details on how to best construct prompts.

          model: The model that will complete your prompt.

              As we improve Claude, we develop new versions of it that you can query. The
              `model` parameter controls which version of Claude responds to your request.
              Right now we offer two model families: Claude, and Claude Instant. You can use
              them by setting `model` to `"claude-2.1"` or `"claude-instant-1.2"`,
              respectively.

              See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/selecting-a-model) for
              additional details and options.

          metadata: An object describing metadata about the request.

          stop_sequences: Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

              Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
              which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

              If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
              text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
              the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
              and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

          stream: Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

              See [streaming](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/streaming) for
              details.

          system: System prompt.

              A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such
              as specifying a particular goal or role. See our
              [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/how-to-use-system-prompts).

          temperature: Amount of randomness injected into the response.

              Defaults to 1. Ranges from 0 to 1. Use temp closer to 0 for analytical /
              multiple choice, and closer to 1 for creative and generative tasks.

          top_k: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

              Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses.
              [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

          top_p: Use nucleus sampling.

              In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options
              for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it
              reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter
              `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

              details.

          metadata: An object describing metadata about the request.

          stop_sequences: Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

              Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
              which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

              If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
              text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
              the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
              and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

          system: System prompt.

              A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such
              as specifying a particular goal or role. See our
              [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/how-to-use-system-prompts).

          temperature: Amount of randomness injected into the response.

              Defaults to 1. Ranges from 0 to 1. Use temp closer to 0 for analytical /
              multiple choice, and closer to 1 for creative and generative tasks.

          top_k: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

              Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses.
              [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

          top_p: Use nucleus sampling.

              In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options
              for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it
              reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter
              `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

        Args:
          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

              Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter
              only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

              Different models have different maximum values for this parameter. See
              [input and output sizes](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/input-and-output-sizes)
              for details.

          messages: Input messages.

              Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
              conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
              conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
              the next `Message` in the conversation.

              Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
              specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
              `assistant` messages. The first message must always use the `user` role.

              If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
              continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
              constrain part of the model's response.

              Example with a single `user` message:

              ```json
              [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
              ```

              Example with multiple conversational turns:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
                { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
              ]
              ```

              Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Please describe yourself using only JSON" },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Here is my JSON description:\n{" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` is
              shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following
              input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              During beta, the Messages API only accepts content blocks of type `"text"`, and
              at most one block per message.

              See our
              [guide to prompt design](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/introduction-to-prompt-design)
              for more details on how to best construct prompts.

          model: The model that will complete your prompt.

              As we improve Claude, we develop new versions of it that you can query. The
              `model` parameter controls which version of Claude responds to your request.
              Right now we offer two model families: Claude, and Claude Instant. You can use
              them by setting `model` to `"claude-2.1"` or `"claude-instant-1.2"`,
              respectively.

              See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/selecting-a-model) for
              additional details and options.

          metadata: An object describing metadata about the request.

          stop_sequences: Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

              Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
              which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

              If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
              text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
              the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
              and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` is
              shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following
              input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              During beta, the Messages API only accepts content blocks of type `"text"`, and
              at most one block per message.

              See our
              [guide to prompt design](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/introduction-to-prompt-design)
              for more details on how to best construct prompts.

          model: The model that will complete your prompt.

              As we improve Claude, we develop new versions of it that you can query. The
              `model` parameter controls which version of Claude responds to your request.
              Right now we offer two model families: Claude, and Claude Instant. You can use
              them by setting `model` to `"claude-2.1"` or `"claude-instant-1.2"`,
              respectively.

              See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/selecting-a-model) for
              additional details and options.

          stream: Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

              See [streaming](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/streaming) for
              details.

          metadata: An object describing metadata about the request.

          stop_sequences: Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

              Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
              which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

              If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
              text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
              the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
              and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

          system: System prompt.

              A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such
              as specifying a particular goal or role. See our
              [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/how-to-use-system-prompts).

          temperature: Amount of randomness injected into the response.

              Defaults to 1. Ranges from 0 to 1. Use temp closer to 0 for analytical /
              multiple choice, and closer to 1 for creative and generative tasks.

          top_k: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

              Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses.
              [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

          top_p: Use nucleus sampling.

              In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options
              for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it
              reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter
              `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

        Create a Message.

        The Messages API is currently in beta.

        Args:
          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

              Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter
              only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

              Different models have different maximum values for this parameter. See
              [input and output sizes](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/input-and-output-sizes)
              for details.

          messages: Input messages.

              Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
              conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
              conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
              the next `Message` in the conversation.

              Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
              specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
              `assistant` messages. The first message must always use the `user` role.

              If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
              continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
              constrain part of the model's response.

              Example with a single `user` message:

              ```json
              [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
              ```

              Example with multiple conversational turns:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
                { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
              ]
              ```

              Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Please describe yourself using only JSON" },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Here is my JSON description:\n{" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` is
              shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following
              input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              During beta, the Messages API only accepts content blocks of type `"text"`, and
              at most one block per message.
