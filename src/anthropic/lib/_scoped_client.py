"""Shared util for building a Bearer-only sub-client for a helper.

Several helpers (the environment poller, the environment worker, the session
tool runner) need to issue requests authenticated by a per-helper credential
(a self-hosted environment key, today) rather than the parent client's own
``X-Api-Key``. They each want to inherit the parent's full configuration —
``timeout``, ``max_retries``, ``http_client``, custom ``default_headers``,
``default_query`` — and override only the auth bits, plus tag every request
with their own ``x-stainless-helper`` value.

:func:`_copy_client_with_bearer_auth` is the one shared construction.

    The returned sub-client inherits the parent's full configuration via
    ``client.copy()`` (``base_url``, ``timeout``, ``max_retries``,
    ``http_client``, ``default_query``, and any custom ``default_headers``).
    Overrides applied:

    - ``auth_token=auth_token`` — the new credential.
    - ``credentials=None`` — any inherited credentials provider is cleared so
      the bearer is the unambiguous auth.
    - ``default_headers`` merges in ``x-stainless-helper: <helper>`` so every
      request the sub-client issues is tagged for SDK telemetry without
      per-call plumbing.
    - ``api_key=None`` — the parent's ``X-Api-Key`` is cleared via a post-hoc
      mutation; today's ``copy()`` treats ``api_key=None`` as "inherit" via
      truthy-or, so the assignment is the only way to drop the parent's API
      key from the sub-client.
    - Any inherited ``Authorization`` / ``X-Api-Key`` entries in the parent's
      custom default-headers are stripped from the sub-client. They would
      otherwise win over the bearer we just set, because
      :meth:`AsyncAnthropic.default_headers` merges ``_custom_headers`` after
      ``auth_headers`` (and so beats the ``Authorization`` value produced by
      ``auth_token``).
