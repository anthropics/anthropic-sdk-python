    messages: Required[Iterable[ToolsBetaMessageParam]]
    """Input messages.

    Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
    conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
    conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
    the next `Message` in the conversation.

    Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
    specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
    `assistant` messages. The first message must always use the `user` role.

    If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
    continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
    constrain part of the model's response.

    Example with a single `user` message:

    ```json
    [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
    ```

    Example with multiple conversational turns:

    ```json
    [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
      { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
      { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
    ]
    ```

    Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
      },
      { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
    ]
    ```

    Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
    content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
    `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
    following input messages are equivalent:

    ```json
    { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
    ```

    ```json
    { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
    ```

    Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

    ```json
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "image",
          "source": {
            "type": "base64",
            "media_type": "image/jpeg",
            "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..."
          }
        },
        { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" }
      ]
    }
    ```

    We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`,
    `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

    See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples) for more
    input examples.

    Note that if you want to include a
    [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use
    the top-level `system` parameter â€” there is no `"system"` role for input
    messages in the Messages API.

    Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
    which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

    If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
    text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
    the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
    and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

    Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully
    deterministic.
    """

    tool_choice: ToolChoice
    """How the model should use the provided tools.

    The model can use a specific tool, any available tool, or decide by itself.
    """

    tools: Iterable[ToolParam]
    """[beta] Definitions of tools that the model may use.

    If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use`
    content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run
    those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally
    return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

    Each tool definition includes:

    - `name`: Name of the tool.
    - `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
    - `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) for the tool `input`
      shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

    For example, if you defined `tools` as:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "get_stock_price",
        "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
        "input_schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "ticker": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
            }
          },
          "required": ["ticker"]
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
    `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "type": "tool_use",
        "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
        "name": "get_stock_price",
        "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
      }
    ]
    ```

    You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
    input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
    message:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "type": "tool_result",
        "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
        "content": "259.75 USD"
      }
    ]
    ```

    Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and
    functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular
    JSON structure of output.

    details.
