    """The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

    Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter
    only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

    Different models have different maximum values for this parameter. See
    [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview) for details.
    """

    messages: Required[Iterable[MessageParam]]
    """Input messages.

    Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
    conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
    conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
    the next `Message` in the conversation.

    Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
    specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
    `assistant` messages. The first message must always use the `user` role.

    If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
    continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
    constrain part of the model's response.

    Example with a single `user` message:

    ```json
    [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
    ```

    Example with multiple conversational turns:

    ```json
    [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
      { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
      { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
    ]
    ```

    Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
      },
      { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
    ]
    ```

    Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
    content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
    `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
    following input messages are equivalent:

    ```json
    { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
    ```

    ```json
    { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
    ```

    Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

    ```json
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "image",
          "source": {
            "type": "base64",
            "media_type": "image/jpeg",
            "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..."
          }
        },
        { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" }
      ]
    }
    ```

    We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`,
    `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

    See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages-examples)
    for more input examples.

    Note that if you want to include a
    [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/system-prompts), you can
    use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input
    messages in the Messages API.

    Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
    which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

    If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
    text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
    the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
    and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.
