Hey! This looks like it's already been fixed.

`BetaContentBlock` is now included in `BetaContentBlockParam` - see [beta_content_block_param.py#L49](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/src/anthropic/types/beta/beta_content_block_param.py#L49)

The fix was added in commit `9843a8e` (Nov 24, 2025), which came after this issue was opened.

Can this issue be closed?
